## Haskel-Calculator

### To run the Haskell RESTfull calculator do the following:


*The assumptions are that the Haskell language and enviroment are installed already
* **Download the ZIP file** unpack the archive file 
* **Open the terminal** go to the directory where the project is extract cd yourdirectory/file/names
* **In the terminal window type the following**  stack build && stack exec haskell

The RESTfull API can be tested in your favorite web browser, in order to test the app go to:

* **home website/route** localhost:3000/home

**To test the mathemathical operations of the calculator type any numbers in the place of the underscore**

* **to test the addition** localhost:3000/add/_/_
* **to test the substraction** localhost:3000/sub/_/_
* **to test the multiplication**localhost:3000/mul/_/_ 
* **to test the multiplication** localhost:3000/div/_/_

In the process of developing this calculator I have used the Yesod book which can be accessed at the following link:
